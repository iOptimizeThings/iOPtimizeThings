### Hi, I'm Maze 👋

**Senior Solutions Architect | Performance Engineer**

Most of my engineering work is **proprietary enterprise code** (C#, SQL, SSAS) built for financial institutions and legal firms. Due to NDAs and intellectual property restrictions, I cannot share a lot of source code publicly.

**Highlights of my private work include:**
* **Architecture:** End-to-end data models for **50M+ row** partitioned datasets.
* **Optimization:** Reducing critical query runtimes by **96%** (5 mins → <10s).
* **Systems:** Low-level C/C# integration for banking host systems.

For a detailed breakdown of my technical capabilities, please refer to my **Resume** or **LinkedIn**.
